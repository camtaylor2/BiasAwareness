              "Biases in social settings often ostracize minorities due to homophily and in-group preference. If an individual views another individual as a member of their group, he/she is more likely to be positively biased and attracted to that person. There will also be a stronger feeling of loyalty to that person. On the contrary, an individual is indifferent to or even negatively disposed to those that are perceived as not a member to their group, or a member of an out-group. For example, when it comes to race, people unconsciously tend to hangout with those that look like them. This is because they usually have cultural similarities. Therefore, when in a setting that is predominantly occupied by a certain race, those that are not a part of that same race may struggle to build connections and are left outside of the social circle. Studies show that there also becomes an increased fear and dislike of those in the out-group due to those in the in-group never gaining comfortability with out-group members.  "

This can appear in the form of expecting students of a marginalized race, ethnicity, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status to not perform as well as students who are of non marginalized identities. For example, an English professor might take notice of a lot more grammar mistakes on an essay that a student whose native language isn’t English wrote and consequently end up grading harsher. This is a very common form of implicit bias in the classroom that may naturally translate to this professor subconsciously expecting less of that student (and the professor may not even be aware of this bias). Another example could be when a professor is much friendlier to her white students and ends up favoring them more, constantly showering them with encouragement and positive comments but neglecting or not taking her students of color seriously.

Statistics show that racial minority students, especially Black and Latino students, are less likely to be recommended into Advanced Placement (AP) or International Baccalaureate (IB) courses compared to their white peers. Instead, they are more likely to be recommended into lower track classes even if they have comparable grades with white students that get recommended into AP or IB courses. Additionally, high school guidance counselors may be more reluctant to encourage minority students to apply to “higher tier” schools and instead encourage them to “keep their list realistic”, implying that they should stick to applying to state schools and community colleges. When these students arrive college, they often face under preparedness in their courses along with elitism from both peers and professors. They face heightened levels of impostor syndrome, thus creating a negative feedback loop where they feel more reluctant to make effort in class because the professors have lower expectations for them.
